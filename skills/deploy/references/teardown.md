# Tear down an existing VSS deployment

### Step 0 — Tear down any existing deployment

Before every deploy, **always** stop any prior VSS stack. This is
mandatory even if you think the host is clean, and especially when
switching profiles (`base` → `search`, `alerts` verification →
`alerts` real-time, etc.). Compose profile flags only *start* the
services listed under the selected profile — they do NOT stop
services from a previously-active profile, so containers from the
prior deploy linger and pass unrelated container-name checks,
contaminate results, and can bind ports the new deploy needs.
