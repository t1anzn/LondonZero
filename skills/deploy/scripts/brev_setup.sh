# Source this script to populate Brev-specific env vars before
# `docker compose up`. See references/brev.md for details.
#
# Usage:
#   source skills/deploy/scripts/brev_setup.sh          # verbose
#   source skills/deploy/scripts/brev_setup.sh --quiet  # no stdout
#
# Inputs (env vars, all optional):
#   BREV_ENV_FILE       Path to environment file (default /etc/environment).
#                       Override in tests.
#   PROXY_PORT          Nginx proxy port (default 7777).
#   BREV_LINK_PREFIX    Secure-link port prefix (default ${PROXY_PORT}).
#
# Exports (only if BREV_ENV_ID is detected):
#   BREV_ENV_ID         From $BREV_ENV_FILE
#   PROXY_PORT          With default 7777
#   BREV_LINK_PREFIX    Computed secure-link prefix
#
# Exit behavior: this script is sourced — it does not `exit`. Errors are
# reported on stderr and the function returns non-zero; missing
# /etc/environment is not an error (returns 0 silently).
