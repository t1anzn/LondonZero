## Licensing

This project uses a dual-license model:

- **Apache-2.0** — applies to all code in the repository except the `ui/` directory.
- **MIT** — applies to the original code under the `ui/` directory, which is derived from [NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit UI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit-UI/).

**All contributions to this repository, regardless of which directory they target, are accepted under the Apache-2.0 license.** Even if you are contributing changes to the `ui/` directory, your contribution will be licensed under Apache-2.0. The original `ui/` code retains its MIT license, but any additions or modifications contributed through this repository are Apache-2.0.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full license texts.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions must include a DCO sign-off. By adding a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit messages, you certify that you wrote (or otherwise have the right to submit) the contribution, and that you are licensing it under the Apache-2.0 license.

To sign off, add the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This appends a line like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

If you have already made commits without a sign-off, you can amend the most recent one:

```bash
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
```

**Pull requests with unsigned commits will not be merged.**

## Pre-commit hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to run security scans before each commit. You must install and enable them before contributing.

### Setup

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### What runs

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) | Scans commits for secrets, credentials, and API keys |

The hooks run automatically on `git commit`. To run them manually against all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If a hook fails, fix the issue before committing. **Pull requests that contain detected secrets will not be merged.**

3. Comment on the issue saying you are going to work on it.
4. Code! Make sure to update unit tests!
5. When done, [create your pull request](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization/compare).
6. Verify that CI passes all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/), or fix if needed.
7. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed.
8. Once reviewed and approved, a maintainer will merge your pull request.

Remember, if you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarifications!
