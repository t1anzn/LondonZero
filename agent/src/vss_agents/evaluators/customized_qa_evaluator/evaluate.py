    template="""You are an expert evaluator assessing a Question Answering (QA) system's response accuracy.

Question Asked: {question}

Agent's Answer: {answer}

Ground Truth Answer: {reference}

EVALUATION TASK:
Compare the agent's answer against the ground truth and determine if they are semantically equivalent with a nuanced score between 0.0 and 1.0.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. **Factual Correctness**: Does the agent's answer convey the same factual information as the ground truth?
    - For Yes/No questions: The boolean value must match exactly.
    - For counting questions: The number must exactly match the ground truth.
    - For temporal questions: Allow ±5 seconds tolerance for timestamps.
    - For descriptive questions: Key facts and details must align.

2. **Completeness**: Does the agent's answer include all key information from the ground truth?
    - Partial answers should receive partial credit.
    - Additional correct details beyond ground truth are acceptable.

3. **Semantic Equivalence**: Different phrasings of the same answer are acceptable.
    - "Yes" and "Yes, a worker dropped one box" are equivalent for a Yes/No question.
    - "60 seconds" and "at the 1 minute mark" are equivalent.
    - "No" and "The worker is not wearing a safety vest" are equivalent.

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 1.0: Perfect match - answer is factually correct and complete
- 0.8-0.9: Essentially correct with minor omissions or slight imprecision
- 0.6-0.7: Partially correct - captures main point but missing some details
- 0.4-0.5: Mixed - some correct elements but significant errors or omissions
- 0.2-0.3: Mostly incorrect but shows some understanding
- 0.0-0.1: Completely wrong or irrelevant answer

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Focus on SEMANTIC correctness, not exact text matching.

OUTPUT:
Think through your evaluation step by step, then output ONLY a single decimal number
(your score from 0.0 to 1.0) on the final line.
